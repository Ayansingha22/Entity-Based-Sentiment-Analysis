# Entity-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the automated process of tagging data according to their sentiment, such as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis allows companies to analyze data at scale, detect insights and automate processes.

A specific domain of sentiment analysis is Entity Based Sentiment Analysis where the machine is able to understand sentiment associated with a particular entity.

Entity-based sentiment analysis focuses on determining the sentiment expressed towards specific entities (e.g., people, organizations, or products) in a text. It identifies entities mentioned in the text and finds whether the sentiment associated with each entity is positive, negative, or neutral.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis, on the other hand, dives deeper by analyzing sentiment towards specific aspects or attributes of an entity (e.g., battery life, camera quality of a phone). It identifies both the entity and its relevant aspects, assessing the sentiment for each aspect individually.

The key difference is that entity-based sentiment looks at overall sentiment toward the entity, while aspect-based sentiment analyzes sentiments on specific characteristics or features of the entity. For example - 

If the text is "The iPhone 14 has an excellent camera, but its battery life is disappointing.", then 
1) Entity-based sentiment analysis: This method will identify "iPhone 14" as the entity and determine the overall sentiment towards it, which might be mixed or neutral due to both positive and negative opinions expressed in the sentence. 

2) Aspect-based sentiment analysis: This method will break it down further, identifying two specific aspects of the "iPhone 14". Therefore, for "camera", the sentiment is positive and for "battery life", the sentiment is negative.
